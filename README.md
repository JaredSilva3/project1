# Plane Crash Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes historical data on plane crashes to uncover trends, causes, and implications of aviation accidents globally. The analysis spans several decades and explores various aspects including geographical distribution, accident causes, and the effectiveness of safety measures over time.

## Objectives
- To identify the most common causes of plane crashes.
- To analyze the trends in plane crashes over decades.
- To evaluate the impact of technological and regulatory changes on aviation safety.
- To provide actionable insights and recommendations for enhancing aviation safety standards.

## Dataset
The dataset, `plane_crashes.csv`, includes records of plane crashes detailing:
- Date and time of crashes
- Geographical locations
- Phases of flight during which accidents occurred
- Causes of accidents
- Fatalities and survivors

## Key Findings
- **Decadal Trends**: Significant reductions in accidents post-World War II, with advancements in aviation technology and stricter regulations.
- **Geographical Insights**: High accident rates in North America and Europe, with emerging trends in Asia.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Use of regression analysis, Chi-squared, and ANOVA tests to validate the trends and hypotheses about crash causes.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning, analysis, and visualizations.
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, folium for mapping.
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration and visual reporting.

## Visualizations
This project includes various visualizations:
- Bar charts showing causes of crashes.
- Line graphs depicting trends over time.
- Geo plots for visualizing geographical data on a map.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
The project concludes with strategic recommendations for aviation safety improvements based on the analyzed data. Enhanced training, technology upgrades, and policy adjustments are suggested to mitigate risks identified through the statistical analysis.

## How to Run the Notebook
Ensure you have Python installed and the necessary libraries. Clone the repository, navigate to the `notebooks/` directory, and launch Jupyter Notebook to open `Plane_Crash_Analysis.ipynb`.
